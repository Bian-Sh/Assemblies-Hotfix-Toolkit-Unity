# Custom Build and Playmode Scripts Sample
A custom play mode script (located in `Editor/CustomPlayModeScript.cs` of the Sample) and build script (located in `Editor/CustomBuildScript.cs` of the Sample) have been provided.  This custom build script creates a build that only includes the currently open scene.  A bootstrap scene is automatically created and a script is added that loads the built scene on startup.  The custom play mode script works similarly to the Use Existing Build (requires built groups) play mode script already included.  The methods added to accomplish this are `CreateCurrentSceneOnlyBuildSetup` and `RevertCurrentSceneSetup` on the `CustomBuildScript`.

For this examples, the build and load paths used by default are `[UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.BuildPath]/[BuildTarget]` and `{UnityEngine.AddressableAssets.Addressables.RuntimePath}/[BuildTarget]` respectively.

Custom play mode scripts inherit from BuildScriptBase.  There are several overridable methods, such as `ClearCachedData`, `IsDataBuilt`, and `CanBuildData<T>`.  However, the most notable method to override is `BuildDataImplementation<TResult>`.  This is the method that is used to setup or build content.

The `CanBuildData<T>` determines if the customs script shows up in the **Build/New Build/** menu or the **Play Mode Scripts** menu.  If the data type being built is `AddressablesPlayModeBuildResult`, the script shows up in the Play Mode Scripts menu.  If the type is `AddressablesPlayerBuildResult`, the script shows up in the Build/New Build/ menu.  

The `ScriptableObject` of the class has already been created, but the Create menu can be used to make another `ScriptableObject` if you desire.  For this `CustomPlayModeScript` the create menu path is **Addressables/Content Builders/Use CustomPlayMode Script**.  By default, this creates a CustomPlayMode.asset ScriptableObject.  The same goes for the `CustomBuildScript`.

When creating custom scripts, you need to specify the `CreateAssetMenu` tag on your class in order to create the ScriptableObject.

Once the `ScriptableObject` is created, add it to the list of ScriptableObjects called Build and Play Mode Scripts on the `AddressableAssetSettings` object.
